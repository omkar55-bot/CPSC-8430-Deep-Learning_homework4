GAN Performance Comparison Report
============================================================

Dataset: CIFAR-10
Image Size: 32x32
Number of Classes: 10

============================================================
MODEL COMPARISON
============================================================

DCGAN:
----------------------------------------
  Status: ✓ Trained
  Image Diversity: 0.5139
  Note: Full IS requires Inception network - this is a simplified metric

WGAN:
----------------------------------------
  Status: ✓ Trained
  Image Diversity: 0.5105
  Note: Full IS requires Inception network - this is a simplified metric

ACGAN:
----------------------------------------
  Status: ✓ Trained
  Image Diversity: 0.5099
  Note: Full IS requires Inception network - this is a simplified metric

COMPARISON NOTES
============================================================

1. Visual Quality: Compare the generated images in the comparison grids
2. Training Stability: Check training curves in results/ directory
3. Convergence: Review loss curves to see which model converged faster
4. Best Images: See results/<gan_type>/best_10_images.png for each model

For full Inception Score (IS) and FID metrics, you would need to:
- Use a pretrained Inception network for IS
- Use a pretrained Inception network for FID
- Compare against real CIFAR-10 statistics

============================================================
BASELINE COMPARISON
============================================================

Compare your results to:
1. Original DCGAN paper results on CIFAR-10
2. Original WGAN paper results
3. Original ACGAN paper results
4. Baseline architecture shown in assignment (adapted for CIFAR-10)

Key differences to note:
- Architecture variations (kernel size, layer structure)
- Training hyperparameters
- Number of training epochs
- Image quality and diversity
