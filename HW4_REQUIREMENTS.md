# HW4 Requirements and Baseline Explanation

## What is Expected in HW4

Based on the submission requirements, here's what you need to deliver:

### 1. **Training Requirements**
- ✅ Train **DCGAN**, **WGAN**, and **ACGAN** networks **from scratch** on CIFAR-10
- ✅ No pretrained models should be used
- ✅ All models should be trained from random initialization

### 2. **Submission Requirements**

#### Report Must Include:
1. **10 Best Generated Pictures**
   - Select and showcase the 10 best images generated by your models
   - These should demonstrate the quality of your trained GANs

2. **Performance Comparison**
   - Compare performance among **DCGAN**, **WGAN**, and **ACGAN**
   - This should include:
     - Visual quality of generated images
     - Training stability (loss curves)
     - Convergence speed
     - Any quantitative metrics you can compute

3. **Comparison to Existing Networks**
   - The requirement states: *"Train networks from scratch and compare to existing networks"*
   - This means you should:
     - Compare your implementation against published results or baseline implementations
     - Discuss how your results compare to what's reported in the original papers
     - Note any differences in architecture or training that might affect results

### 3. **Grading Breakdown**
- **Basic Requirements (Required):**
  - ✅ DCGAN implementation and training
  - ✅ WGAN implementation and training
  
- **Bonus (Optional but Recommended):**
  - ✅ ACGAN implementation and training

### 4. **Code Submission**
- Submit your code to GitHub
- Code should be well-organized and runnable
- Include proper documentation

## Purpose of the Baseline Model

The **baseline model** shown in the images serves several purposes:

### 1. **Reference Architecture**
- Provides a **starting point** for your DCGAN implementation
- Shows the expected architecture structure:
  - Generator: Dense → Reshape → ConvTranspose layers with kernel=5
  - Discriminator: Conv2D layers with kernel=5, text embedding integration
  - Specific hyperparameters (lr=0.0002, beta=0.5, momentum=0.9)

### 2. **Architecture Guidelines**
- **Kernel size**: 5 (not the standard 4 used in many DCGAN implementations)
- **Text/Conditioning**: Shows how to integrate conditional information (for ACGAN)
- **Layer structure**: Dense → Reshape pattern for generator input
- **BatchNorm momentum**: 0.9 (as specified in baseline)

### 3. **Comparison Point**
- You can compare your results against:
  - The baseline architecture's expected performance
  - Published results from the original papers
  - Other implementations you find online

### 4. **Adaptation Note**
- The baseline shows **text conditioning** (119-dim input for hair/eyes attributes)
- For **CIFAR-10**, you adapt this to:
  - **10 class labels** instead of text attributes
  - **32×32 images** instead of 64×64
  - Same architectural principles but adapted to the dataset

## What Your Implementation Should Do

### ✅ Training Phase
1. Train DCGAN from scratch on CIFAR-10
2. Train WGAN from scratch on CIFAR-10  
3. Train ACGAN from scratch on CIFAR-10 (bonus)

### ✅ Evaluation Phase
1. Generate images from each trained model
2. Select the 10 best images per model
3. Create visualizations and comparisons

### ✅ Analysis Phase
1. Compare the three GANs:
   - Which produces better quality images?
   - Which trains more stably?
   - Which converges faster?
   - What are the trade-offs?

2. Compare to existing work:
   - How do your results compare to the original papers?
   - How do they compare to the baseline architecture?
   - What factors might explain differences?

## Key Differences: Baseline vs. Your Implementation

| Aspect | Baseline (Image) | Your Implementation (CIFAR-10) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Dataset** | Faces with attributes | CIFAR-10 (10 classes) |
| **Image Size** | 64×64 | 32×32 |
| **Conditioning** | Text (119-dim) | Class labels (10 classes) |
| **Architecture** | Dense→Reshape, kernel=5 | Same principles, adapted |
| **Training** | From scratch | From scratch ✅ |
